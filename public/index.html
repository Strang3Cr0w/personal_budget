    <h1>Personal Budget - Let's start a budget!</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Starting a budget is essential to reaching your financial goals. Without a budget you 
        have no way of keeping track of what you spend and thus no way of keeping yourself 
        inline with your financial goals. Additionally, budgeting doesn't have to be hard. 
        With this easy budgeting software, you can easily start a budget and keep track of 
        what and when you spend. You can also view a summary of your budget on the summary page, 
        just click the link on the right within the nav menu. Let's get started!
    </p>
    <div >
        <p class="budget_explain">
            Let's start by inputting the max amount you want to spend each month per category. The first two
            categories are considered fixed expenses, mortgage/rent and utilities. These are expenses that you
            will have to pay no matter what.<br><br> The following categories are variable expenses. You have control over
            how much you spend on these categories. Set some realistic, attainable maximums for your variable
            expenses. We will take what you spend and compare it against your income. Ideally, the difference should
            be positive and you can then put that money towards your financial goals!<br><br> Once you've entered
            the absolute maximum you're willing to spend each month for every category, save it with the submit button.
            You can always change these amounts later as needed. Then, go to the expenses page to enter your expenses.
