                Let's start by inputting the max amount you want to spend each month per category. The first two
                categories are considered fixed expenses, mortgage/rent and utilities. These are expenses that you
                will have to pay no matter what.<br><br> The three following categories are variable expenses. You have control over
                how much you spend on these categories. Set some realistic, attainable maximums for your variable
                expenses. We will take what you spend and compare it against your income. Ideally, the difference should
                be positive and you can then put that money towards your financial goals!<br><br> Once you've entered
                the absolute maximum you're willing to spend each month for every category, save it with the submit button.
                You can always change these amounts later as needed. Then, go to the expenses page to enter your expenses.
